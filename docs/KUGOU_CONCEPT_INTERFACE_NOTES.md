# KuGou Concept Interface Notes

## Current Scope

This fork is adding KuGou Concept (`platform: lite`) support in small steps.

Implemented in `server.js`:

- `GET /api/kugou/login/status`
- `GET /api/kugou/login/qr/key`
- `GET /api/kugou/login/qr/create?key=...`
- `GET /api/kugou/login/qr/check?key=...`
- `POST /api/kugou/login/cookie`
- `GET /api/kugou/logout`
- `GET /api/kugou/search?keywords=...&limit=...`
- `GET /api/kugou/song/url?hash=...&albumId=...&albumAudioId=...&quality=...`
- `GET /api/kugou/user/playlists`
- `GET /api/kugou/playlist/tracks?id=...`
- `GET /api/kugou/lyric?hash=...&albumAudioId=...`
- `GET /api/kugou/listen-counts?type=1`
- `POST /api/kugou/playlist/create`
- `POST /api/kugou/playlist/add-song`
- `GET /api/kugou/song/like/check?ids=...`
- `POST /api/kugou/song/like`

Implemented in `public/index.html`:

- Login modal tab for KuGou Concept.
- QR image loading through `/api/kugou/login/qr/key`.
- QR status polling through `/api/kugou/login/qr/check`.
- Account modal display and logout for KuGou Concept.
- Search mode tab `KG` for KuGou-only search.
- `All` search now merges Netease, QQ, and KuGou results.
- KuGou search results are playable through `/api/kugou/song/url`.
- User playlist panels, playlist detail panels, queue loading, and the 3D playlist shelf can load KuGou playlists.
- KuGou songs request lyrics through `/api/kugou/lyric` instead of falling back to Netease lyrics.
- KuGou collect actions write to KuGou playlists, and the collect modal can create a KuGou playlist before adding the current song.
- KuGou heart actions sync with the writable liked playlist instead of showing a placeholder message.
- KuGou playlist detail shows an extra `平台播放次数` sort option. It reads cumulative account listening rank data from `/api/kugou/listen-counts?type=1`.

The QR check route saves `userid` and `token` into the local KuGou cookie file after status `4`, but does not return the token to the frontend response.

## Notes

- KuGou Concept uses `liteAppid = 3116` and `liteClientver = 11440`.
- QR key creation still uses `appid = 1001`, matching KuGouMusicApi behavior, while the QR page and check route use the lite app id.
- KuGou login requests need signed params, including `dfid`, `mid`, `uuid`, `clientver`, and `clienttime`.
- KuGou Android API requests use the lite signature salt `LnT6xpN3khm36zse0QzvmgTZ3waWdRSA`.
- KuGou song URL requests also need a `key` generated from `hash`, lite sign-key salt, `appid`, `mid`, and `userid`.
- KuGou Concept quality UI should use the app-facing four-level naming: `Hi-Res音质` (`quality=high`), `无损音质` (`quality=flac`), `高品音质` (`quality=320`), and `标准音质` (`quality=128`). The old generic `jymaster` preference is folded into `hires` for KuGou providers so the menu does not show a duplicate highest tier.
- Song URL responses must display the resolved quality from the returned bitrate, not only the requested quality. For example, if a highest-tier request returns FLAC bitrate, the UI should show `无损音质` instead of pretending it is `Hi-Res音质`.
- KuGou platform play counts use `listenservice.kugou.com/v2/get_list`, `list_type = 1` for cumulative account listening rank, and the response item field `listen_count`.
- `/api/kugou/listen-counts?type=1` also supplements those rank counts with paged recent play-history records from `gateway.kugou.com/playhistory/v1/get_songs`; that endpoint uses the `bp` cursor and item field `pc`.
- The play-history endpoint improves coverage but is still bounded by what KuGou returns for the current account. Playlist songs outside both sources should display `暂无` instead of a fake count.
- The listening rank endpoint itself returns the top 120 songs, not a complete account-wide per-song database.
- The listening rank request needs the RSA-encrypted `p` payload built from `{ clienttime, token }`; this project implements it with Node's built-in `crypto` and does not add `node-forge`.
- KuGou `cloudlist.service` write routes such as `add_list` and `add_song` should follow EchoMusic/KuGouMusicApi and avoid forcing an extra `x-router` header.
- Platform audio effects such as KuGou sound effects, Viper, equalizer, or Dolby-style effects are not implemented yet. Current `effect` code in the UI is visual/animation behavior, not provider audio effects. 2026-07-04 check: public KuGou Viper pages describe an SDK/cooperation route, and MakcRe/KuGouMusicApi exposes Viper quality candidates such as `viper_atmos`, `viper_tape`, and `viper_clear`, plus an effect-playlist API; this does not yet verify a usable official preset API for app effects such as `3D丽音`, `超重低音`, `HiFi现场`, or `纯净人声`. Do not present local WebAudio presets as official KuGou effects.
- The local cookie can contain display-only non-ASCII fields such as nickname. Outbound KuGou API `Cookie` headers must only include safe ASCII auth/device fields.
- `.kugou-cookie` is local private state and must stay ignored by Git.
- This integration must not bypass VIP, paid music, copyright, region, or platform restrictions.

## Next Steps

- Add a more trustworthy KuGou VIP/member-detail route if one can be verified.
- Keep write-route validation conservative because playlist creation, collect, and heart actions modify a real KuGou account.
- Keep provider logic separate instead of forcing KuGou into existing Netease/QQ branches.
